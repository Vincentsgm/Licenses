# Licenses
Licenses for Vincentsgm early access projects

This repositery holds licenses for Vincentsgm's GTA5 mods.
Each mod has its own file, with Discord IDs hashed in SHA256 & stored line by line.
The authentification is done in game using a Discord Rich Presence DLL present inside the GTA5's root folder.

The hashing is just a way to prevent people to finding out easily who owns licenses, however it is all easily accessible inside my Discord Server by looking at the roles.

When you purchase a product from Vincentsgm, or subscribe to the Patreon Page, your Discord ID will be added to the corresponding database within 24 hours of the purchase/subscription's notice.

You can subscribe to Patreon here: https://www.patreon.com/vincentsgm
And purchase products from here: https://discord.gg/g82638j

NOTE: For the authentification to work, you must use a desktop version of Discord (regular, Canary...), browser will not work.
